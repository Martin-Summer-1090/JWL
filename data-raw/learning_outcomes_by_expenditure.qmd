## The data

We use a dataset from our world in data for illustrative purposes.

```{r}
learning_outcomes <- 
  read.csv("~/R/Statistics_JWL/data/learning_outcomes_and_expenditure/average-learning-outcomes-by-total-education-expenditure-per-capita.csv")
```

We select the years from 2005 - 2015

```{r}
data_outcomes <- learning_outcomes[learning_outcomes$Year >= 2005 & learning_outcomes$Year <= 2015, ]

names(data_outcomes) <- c("Entity", "Code", "Year", "Score", "Exp", "Pop", "Cont")


```
