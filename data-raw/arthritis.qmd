In chapter 5 we read and analyze data from a clinical trial. The onjective is to
teach the use of tapply for producing and analyzing tables from  these data.
In order to do so we use an example data from an article in the The R Journal Vol. 11/01, June 2019
by Armin Str√∂bl "atable: Create Tables for Clinical Trial Reports". This is just a 
real life dataset to play with in our context. We include it into our data collection
for the course.

```{r}
library(multgee)
data(arthritis)
# All columns of arthritis are numeric. Set more appropriate classes:
arthritis = within(arthritis, {
score = ordered(y)
baselinescore = ordered(baseline)
time = paste0("Month ", time)
sex = factor(sex, levels = c(1,2), labels = c("female", "male"))
trt = factor(trt, levels = c(1,2), labels = c("placebo", "drug"))})
```
