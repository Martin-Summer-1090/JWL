\description{
The dataset arthritis is from the package multgee Touloumis (2015). This
dataset contains observations of the self-assessment score of arthritis, an ordered variable with five
categories, collected at baseline and three follow-up times during a randomised comparative study of
alternative treatments of 302 patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
The data came from a randomized clinical trial that aimed to evaluate
the effectiveness of the drug Auranofin versus the placebo therapy for the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis. The five-level (1=poor, . . . , 5=very good) ordinal
multinomial response variable was the self-assessment of rheumatoid arthritis recorded at one
(t = 1), three (t = 2) and five (t = 3) follow-up months.
