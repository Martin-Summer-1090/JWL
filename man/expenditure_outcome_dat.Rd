\description{
Average learning outcomes from standardized,
psychometrically-robust international and regional
achievement tests. In order to maximize
coverage by country, tests have been
harmonized and pooled across
subjects (math, reading, science) and
levels (primary and secondary education).
}
\details{
This dataset covers countries over 2005â€“2015.
The globally comparable achievement outcomes were
constructed by linking standardized,
psychometrically-robust international and
regional achievement tests, including:
TIMSS, PIRLS, PISA, FIMS, FISS, SIMS,
SISS, SRC, RLS, MLA, IAEP, SACMEQ, PASEC, and LLECE.

Expenditure data are from UNESCO household surveys.
This dataset used the UNESCO data on household and
government expenditure on education as a share of GDP,
added the shares together and multiplied it with
GDP per capita (PPP in constant 2011 international $
as provided by the World Bank).
